2456：Aggressive cows

农夫 John 建造了一座很长的畜栏(数轴)，它包括N (2≤N≤100,000)个隔间，这些小隔间的位置为x0,...,xN-1 (0≤xi≤1,000,000,000,均为整数,各不相同).
John的C (2≤C≤N)头牛每头分到一个隔间。牛都希望互相离得远点省得互相打扰。怎样才能使最近的两头牛之间的距离尽可能的大，这个“最大的最近距离”是多少呢？

描述：
Farmer John has built a new long barn, with N (2 <= N <= 100,000) stalls. The stalls are located along a straight line at positions x1,...,xN (0 <= xi <= 1,000,000,000).

His C (2 <= C <= N) cows don't like this barn layout and become aggressive towards each other once put into a stall. To prevent the cows from hurting each other, FJ want to assign the cows to the stalls, such that the minimum distance between any two of them is as large as possible. What is the largest minimum distance?

输入：
* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and C
* Lines 2~N+1: Line i+1 contains an integer stall location, xi

输出：
* Line 1: One integer: the largest minimum distance

样例输出：
3

提示：
OUTPUT DETAILS:
FJ can put his 3 cows in the stalls at positions 1, 4 and 8, resulting in a minimum distance of 3.
Huge input data,scanf is recommended.
